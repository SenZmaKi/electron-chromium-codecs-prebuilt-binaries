- Precompiled binaries for electron with support for proprietary codecs (ac3, hevc)
- Credit to https://github.com/ThaUnknown/electron-chromium-codecs for the build instructions
- Couldn't build Mac binaries cause I don't have a Mac
- The compilation scripts are mostly broken so be sure to monitor the script as it runs if you wanna use them
